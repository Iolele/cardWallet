<h3>Welcome to WÅLLY!</h3>

<p>
    These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions that govern access to, and use of, the websites and
    Wålly mobile applications made available by Wålly, Inc. that enable a user to send or manage
    gift cards and receive the other services from Wålly as described herein (collectively, the “Services”).  These Terms are a legal
    agreement between you (“you,” or “your”) and Gyft.  By clicking to “Accept” these Terms where this option is made available to you
    and/or by using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.  These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of
    any other agreement you may have with any other party for products, services or otherwise.
</p>


<p>
    We do not charge you for the use of Wålly or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, companies and organizations
    pay us to show you ads for their products and services.
    By using our products, you agree that we may serve you advertisements that we believe may be relevant to you and your interests.
    We use your personal information to help you decide which ads to show you.

</p>


<p>
    We do not sell your personal information to advertisers, and we do not share information that directly identifies you
    (for example, by name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers, unless you give us specific permission.
    Instead, advertisers can tell us things like what type of audience they want to see, and then we show ads to people who might be interested.
    We provide advertisers with reports on the performance of their ads to help them understand how people interact with their content.
</p>

<p>
    Our data policy explains how we collect and use your personal information to select any of the ads you see and provide all
    of the other services described below. You can also visit Settings at any time to review the privacy choices
    you have about how we use your data.
